# Installation

Use a fresh Python environment, install `openseespy-solvers`, then add only the optional
backends you need.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Python | 3.12 or newer |
| NumPy | 1.26 or newer |
| scipy | 1.12 or newer |
| OpenSeesPy | Needed to run OpenSees analyses and examples; use a serial build |

`openseespy-solvers` does not install OpenSeesPy by default. This keeps the base package
small and lets users add OpenSeesPy only when they need the OpenSees integration.

## Quick Install

```bash
python -m pip install openseespy-solvers
```

If OpenSeesPy is not already installed in the environment:

```bash
python -m pip install "openseespy-solvers[opensees]"
```

## Fresh Environment {#full-setup}

Conda:

```bash
conda create -n openseespy-solvers python=3.12
conda activate openseespy-solvers
python -m pip install "openseespy-solvers[opensees]"
```

venv:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install "openseespy-solvers[opensees]"
```

## Optional Backends

### UMFPACK {#umfpack}

UMFPACK enables the `openseespy_solvers.scipy.umfpack` CPU direct solver.

Linux or macOS:

```bash
python -m pip install "openseespy-solvers[umfpack]"
```

Windows:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-umfpack
```

If pip builds from source on Linux, you may also need SuiteSparse from your system package
manager, for example `libsuitesparse-dev` on Debian or Ubuntu.

### NVIDIA GPU {#gpu}

GPU solvers require an NVIDIA driver and CUDA-compatible wheels. Start by checking the CUDA
generation reported by the driver:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

For CUDA 13.x:

```bash
python -m pip install "openseespy-solvers[cuda13]"
```

For CUDA 12.x:

```bash
python -m pip install "openseespy-solvers[cuda12]"
```

These extras install both `cupy` and nvmath for the selected CUDA generation. Keep `cupy` and
nvmath on the same CUDA generation. Avoid installing the generic `cupy` package unless you
intentionally want to build `cupy` from source.

## Development Install

Clone the repository when you want examples, benchmarks, tests, or documentation sources:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaaraujo/openseespy-solvers.git
cd openseespy-solvers
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,opensees]"
```

Add optional backends from the sections above as needed.

## Verify {#verify}

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip check
python -m pytest
```

Run two small OpenSeesPy examples:

```bash
cd examples
python solvers/scipy_spsolve.py
python solvers/scipy_eigsh.py
```

GPU and UMFPACK tests run only when the corresponding optional packages are installed;
otherwise they are skipped.

For timing comparisons against native OpenSees solvers:

```bash
python brick_bar.py
python brick_bar_eigen.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### OpenSeesPy Parallel Builds

These solvers target serial OpenSeesPy. GPU backends accelerate the sparse solve, but the
OpenSees model assembly still happens in one process. Parallel or MPI OpenSeesPy builds are
not supported by this package. See [PythonSparse and parallelism](development/pythonsparse-interface.md#parallelism).

### UMFPACK Fails to Install on Windows

Use conda-forge:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-umfpack
```

The PyPI package may need source-build tools that are inconvenient on Windows.

### cupy Cannot Find CUDA Libraries

Install the `cupy` wheel with bundled runtime libraries:

```bash
python -m pip install "cupy-cuda13x[ctk]"   # or cupy-cuda12x[ctk]
```

Also confirm that `nvidia-smi` works and that `cupy` and nvmath use the same CUDA generation.

## Build Documentation Locally

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[docs]"
mkdocs serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
